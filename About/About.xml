[h1] Content [/h1]
You remember those times in college where you would just take some pills and learning was done by itself?
Your pawns now can get that feeling for themselfs.

Offers new drugs to improve the learning of skills.
However those do come with serveral side-effects and need to be taken with caution.
Good thing though is that most side effects can be treated.

Adds four new medical drugs: Ritalin, Adderall, Ambien and Prozac.
Ritalin improves the learning rate.
Adderal improves the worst skill of the user.
Ambien is for better/less sleeping.
Prozac is against burnout and chronic stress.

Taking Ritalin or Adderal may lead (depending on dose) to serious sideeffects, include eating disorders, sleeping disorders, chronic stress and worst burn out.
However, these can be cured with the medication provided.
